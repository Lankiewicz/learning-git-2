      <p>Once I was seven years old my momma told me, <br>
Go make yourself some friends or you'll be lonely<br>
Once I was seven years old<br>
<br><br>
	      It was a big, big world but we thought we were bigger<br>
Pushing each other to the limits, we were learning quicker<br>
By eleven smoking herb and drinking burning liquor <br>
Never rich so we were out to make that steady figure<br>
<br><br>
Once I was eleven years old my daddy told me,<br> 
Go get yourself a wife or you'll be lonely<br>
Once I was eleven years old<br>
